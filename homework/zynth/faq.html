  <h2>Where can I find information about how much something will cost? </h2>
  <p>THIS PAGE includes pricing options for common projects. If something is not listed on this page feel free to E-mail me asking about it. Make sure that you are including as much detail in your E-mail as possible and I will get back to you as quickly as I can.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
  <h2>How does your pricing work?</h2>
<p>All quoted prices are final and non-negotiable. Projects will be started when at least half of the agreed upon price is delivered. Paying full price up front will not raise your current place in line.

  <h2>How can I get in touch with ZYNTH to further discuss plans and pricing?</h2>

<h2>How quickly will the work that I ask for be completed?</h2>
