            <h1>Scenario Purpose</h1>
            <p>The purpose of presenting these scenarios is to provoke thoughtful discussion and critical thinking about the ethical implications of AI technologies in our society. 

                Each scenario represents a real-world dilemma that individuals may encounter, reflecting the complex moral and ethical considerations inherent in the deployment of AI. By exploring these scenarios, I aim to raise awareness of the potential benefits and pitfalls of AI and encourage participants to consider the broader societal impacts of our increasing technological advancements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h1>Critical Reflection</h1>
            <p>Through these scenarios, I aim to promote critical reflection on the ethical challenges posed by AI technologies and the implications for individuals, communities, and society at large wether the situation is classified overall as helpful or harmful at first glance. 

                By confronting these dilemmas in a safe and structured environment, participants have the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the ethical complexities surrounding AI and develop strategies for ethical decision-making in their personal and professional lives. Ultimately, the goal is to empower individuals to navigate the ethical dimensions of AI technology responsibly and contribute to the ethical development and governance of emerging technologies while increasing the knowledge base of tech users and nonusers alike.</p>

        <div class="column">
            <h1>Audience Engagement</h1>
            <p>Audience members are asked to react to these scenarios to actively engage in ethical deliberation and decision-making. By prompting individuals to consider how they would respond in these situations, I invite them to reflect on their values, beliefs, and ethical principles. 

                Audience participation fosters empathy, understanding, and perspective-taking, allowing for a richer exploration of the ethical dilemmas posed by AI technologies. Moreover, discussing diverse responses encourages dialogue and collaboration, promoting mutual learning and the exchange of ideas.</p>
