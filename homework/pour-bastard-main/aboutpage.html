      <h1>COUPLE OF POUR BASTARDS.</h1>
      <p>So basically, these two kiddos met each other when they were 17 years old and fell in love somewhat shortly after. The lil' lady on the right has gone through the trials and tribulations of nursing school, owning a German Sheppard and Husky mix, and living in a tiny house which is basically a jail cell with a coffeemaker. All of this, and she still supports this weirdo on the left side of the photograph, crazy enough to actually marry him. She still supports him emotionally and spiritually in his creative efforts, as crazy and wildspirited as they might be.
        After 5 years in the United States Air Force, the mustache on the left separated from the military and started working for a hospital doing security. While hard at work providing security services for the Hospital where he worked, he found a few YouTube videos about how to brew your own beer. After a couple of bad batches of brewskis, they finally perfected the recipe and cannot wait to serve nothing but the highest quality drafts across the bar to average beer enjoyers like yourself. 
        Try our shit though, for real, shit's mad tasty.
